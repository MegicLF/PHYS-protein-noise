Overall question:
When is approximating noise as additive/multiplicative justified?

System to look at:
1. 1 gene/mRNA/protein, no regulation
2. 1 gene/mRNA/protein, nth order feedback (n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
(optional) 3. 2+ gene


For 1 gene model:
Questions: (for additive/muliplicative/Gillespie)
1. When does prob dist. match CME's prob dist. (mean & SD)?
   How are the skewness & kurtosis different in different models?
2. What is the optimal (range) of noise value?
3. Dependence of noise value on parameters (transcription/translation rate, degradation, etc.)
   Does ne parameter 'dominate' noise?
   
Make comparisons via:
1. mean, std, location of peak/mode, skewness, kurtosis
2. Lp spaces: should be between 0 and 2; 0 is no difference, and 2 refers to larger differences
3. Kullback-Leibler divergence: the amount of information you lose, if you use approximate distribution rather than the true distribution
